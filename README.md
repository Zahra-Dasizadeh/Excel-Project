The dataset in file E Commerce Dashboard Project.xlsx contains the sales data for different product.
In this project, I formatted the dataset by highlighting duplicate records and using an icon set to show data changes. I also formatted the dates to "dd-mmm-yy" format. I created a table for month-wise Sales and Profit and calculated the average profit and sales for each Product Category and Product across different regions. Additionally, I identified the top 3 best-performing and bottom 3 worst-performing products. I created charts to visualize profit trends month-wise and region-wise, and performed statistical analysis on the Sales and Profit data. Finally, I designed a Sales Dashboard with key visuals and insights.
